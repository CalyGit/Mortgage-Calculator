# Mortgage-Calculator

# AFCA Bank Mortgage Calculator
This is a Python program that calculates monthly mortgage payments and the total amount payable for a given principal, interest rate, and mortgage term.

## Usage
To use the mortgage calculator, follow these steps:

* Open a Python environment or terminal.
* Clone or download the repository containing the 'mortgage calculator-Copy1 (1).ipynb' file.
* Run the 'mortgage calculator-Copy1 (1).ipynb' file in your Python environment or terminal.
* Enter the mortgage loan principal, annual interest rate (as a percentage), and the number of years you wish to pay off the mortgage.
* The program will then calculate the monthly mortgage payment and the total amount payable.

## How It Works
The program prompts the user to input the mortgage loan principal, annual interest rate, and the number of years they wish to pay off the mortgage. The program then calculates the monthly mortgage payment and the total amount payable using the following formula:


M = P * r * (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1)
where:

* M is the monthly mortgage payment
* P is the mortgage loan principal
* r is the monthly interest rate
* n is the total number of monthly payments (equal to the number of years times 12)
The program then outputs the results in a formatted string, displaying the mortgage loan principal, the annual interest rate, the monthly payment, and the total amount payable.

## Dependencies
This program does not have any external dependencies.
